# Hytale Playtime Tracker 🎮

A quick and easy tool to see how much time you've actually spent in Hytale. 

### What it shows you:
* **Total Playtime:** Your life's work in Hytale (Hours/Minutes/Seconds).
* **Total Sessions:** How many times you've actually launched the game.
* **Average Session:** How long you usually play before taking a break.

### How to use:
1. Download the `hytale_playtime.exe` from the Releases section.
2. Double-click it.
3. That’s it! The tool automatically finds your Hytale logs and does the math for you.

### Why use this?
* **No setup:** You don't need to install anything extra.
* **Privacy:** It doesn't send your data anywhere; it just reads your local logs.
* **Fast:** It processes hundreds of log files in less than a second.

*Note: It can only count the time for log files currently on your computer. If you've deleted your UserData folder recently, those hours won't show up!*

**Press Enter when you're done reading your stats to close the window.**
